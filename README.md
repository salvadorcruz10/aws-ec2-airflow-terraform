# AWS-ec2-airflow

Project designed to deploy an Apache Airflow cluster on AWS, backed by RDS PostgreSQL for metadata, S3 for logs and SQS as message broker with CeleryExecutor
                                                           
This project uses basically Terraform to build all the infrastructure as needed according to parameters provided. 

### Prerequisites

Have SSH keys configured without a passphrase using:
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

### Terraform version

0.12.6

### How to deploy an environment

It is optional to create an S3 bucket to store the Terraform state

```
aws s3 mb s3://bucket-name
```

In [backend_vars](IaC/backend_vars) file configure parameters for the backend, for example

```
bucket="my-bucket-name"
key="terraform.tfstate"
region="us-east-1"
```

In [terraform.tfvars](IaC/terraform.tfvars) file configure parameters for your infrastructure, for example

```
webserver_instance_type = "t2.micro"
scheduler_instance_type = "t2.micro"
worker_instance_type    = "t2.micro"
```
Run Terraform's init command with its configuration file

```
terraform init -reconfigure -backend-config=backend_vars 
```

Run Terraform's plan command to have an insight of the infrastructure

```
terraform plan -var-file=terraform.tfvars 
```

Run Terraform apply command to build your infrastructure

```
terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

Run Terraform destroy command to delete your infrastructure

```
terraform destroy -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```
